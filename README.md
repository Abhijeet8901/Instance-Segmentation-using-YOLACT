# Instance-Segmentation-using-YOLACT

This is implementation of the paper [Yolact:《YOLACT: Real-time Instance Segmentation》](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02689).

For backbone, I have used used Resnet-50 and it was trained on Pascal VOC Dataset.

Even though it was only trianed for 8 hours on Colab GPU for 23 epochs, it managed to achieve fairly good results.
