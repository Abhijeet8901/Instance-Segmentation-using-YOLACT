# Instance-Segmentation-using-YOLACT

In this project, we achieved Instance Segmentation using YOLACT.

For backbone, I have used used Resnet-50 and it was trained on Pascal VOC Dataset.

Even though it was only trianed for 8 hours on Colab GPU for 23 epochs, it managed to achieve fairly good results.
